## 🎯 Benefits of Microservices

### ✅ Scalability
- Scale individual services based on demand
- Independent resource allocation
- Better performance optimization

### ✅ Maintainability
- Smaller, focused codebases
- Easier debugging and testing
- Clear service boundaries

### ✅ Deployment
- Independent deployments
- Zero-downtime updates
- Rollback capabilities

### ✅ Technology
- Use different tech stacks per service
- Technology diversity
- Best tool for each job

### ✅ Team Autonomy
- Different teams can work on different services
- Parallel development
- Reduced conflicts

## 🔧 Development

### Individual Service Development
```bash
# Start specific service
cd microservices/auth-service
npm install
npm run dev
```

### All Services Development
```bash
# Start all services
cd microservices
docker-compose up -d
```
